About Self-Validated Configurations
###################################

The NVIDIA GPU Operator Self-Validated Program helps end users who want to use
NVIDIA GPUs with a Kubernetes-based software stack that is not supported by NVIDIA.

This program enables vendors of Kubernetes-based software stacks to self-validate
the NVIDIA GPU Operator with their software so that they can meet the needs of
their end users.

When a partner successfully self-validates their software with the GPU Operator,
the partner develops the documentation that end users need.
Then the partner and NVIDIA add the document to this NVIDIA GPU Operator product documentation.
End users can read the details about the software versions that are validated,
how to use the GPU Operator with the software stack, and how to report issues.

.. important::

   The self-validated program relies on community support and does not constitute
   enterprise support from NVIDIA AI Enterprise.
   While a self-validated stack is a necessary first step, it does not guarantee
   an automatic elevation to enterprise support from NVIDIA AI Enterprise at some
   point in the future.
